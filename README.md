Recommendation systems have been around us for quite some time now. Youtube, Facebook, Amazon, and many others provide some sort of recommendations to their users.  
Here, we explore the relationship between the pair of items (the user who bought Y, also bought Z). We find the missing rating with the help of the ratings given to the other items by the user.  
It was first invented and used by Amazon in 1998. Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the userâ€™s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.
